# Final C++ Project

This reposeory has been created to enable me and my friend collaborate on our final project and version controlling. 
This C++ program is basically a puzzle solving problem and it was not the best I have done. The project recived an overall grade of 77/100.

Thanks to Raphael Seymoor for working with me on this project.
