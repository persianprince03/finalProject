# Final C++ Project

This repository has been created to enable me and my friend to collaborate on our final project and version controlling. 
This C++ program is basically a puzzle-solving problem and it was not the best I have done. The project received an overall grade of 77/100.

Thanks to Raphael Seymour for working with me on this project.
